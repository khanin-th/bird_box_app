# bird_box_app
Object detection model for bird

## Setup a new virtual environment to run this app (if you never had TensorFlow Object Detection API installed)
### Step 1: 
Create a new directory to work in (for example here I will create a folder called "bird_box" in Downloads directory) and navigate to the new directory <br>
```
mkdir C:\Users\pui_s\Downloads\bird_box && cd C:\Users\pui_s\Downloads\bird_box
```
