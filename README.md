# bird_box_app
Object detection model for bird

## Setup a new virtual environment to run this app (if you never had TensorFlow Object Detection API installed)
### Step 1: 
Create a new directory to work in (for example here I will create a folder called "bird_box" in Downloads directory) and navigate to the new directory <br>
```
mkdir C:\Users\pui_s\Downloads\bird_box && cd C:\Users\pui_s\Downloads\bird_box
```

### Step 2:
Create a new virtual environment (so that your main python won't be disturbed), and name it, which is `bird_od` in this example
```
python -m venv bird_od
```

### Step 3:
Activate the virtual environment to work in. Now you will notice a bracket pre-appended to what being displayed in the command line windows as shown below
```
.\bird_od\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3:
Create 2 new directories to store `TensorFlow Object Detection API` and its dependency `prtobuf`, here I am creating a new directory called "Tensorflow" and 2 new sub-directories for such purposes
```
mkdir 
```
